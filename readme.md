# ENPM 808A --> Machine Learning Final Project

## Introduction

This is my final project submission for ENPM808A -  Introduction to Machine Learning course. The course was taken in the Fall of 2022 semester at the University of Maryland. 

We are provided with a novel dataset on which we need to perform regression. The data comes from multiple path planning MPC tests conducted with a car-like robot model. The data is stored in multiple CSV files and organized in columns as follows:

- Laser Range - 1:1080
- Final Goal (x,y,qk,qr) ‚Äì 1081:1084
- Local Goal (x,y,qk,qr) ‚Äì 1085:1088
- Pose (x,y,qk,qr) ‚Äì 1089:1090
- Cmd_vel_v - 1091
- Cmd_vel_w - 1092

### Goal of the Project

To build regression models that can learn to predict translational valocity (ùë£), and angular velocity (ùë§) based on lidar data, robot pose, final goal and local goals.

## Techniques and Concepts explored

| Data Cleaning | ML Models | Feature Engineering | Key Concepts |
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
| Training/Validation/Testing data split, Data Imputation | Linear Regression with SGD, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Neural Networks | Feature Selection, Feature Reduction, Outlier Analysis, Feature Scaling | Regularization, Overfitting, Hyperparameter Tuning, Evaluation Metrics, Learning Curves

## Machine Learning Pipeline

The strategy was as follows:
- Train model with default parameters
- Run prediction on Training Data and Testing Data
- Compute ùëÖ2 score and Mean Square Error
- Tune Hyperparameters
  * Build parameter dictionary
  * Fit data on Validation Set to find bestparameters
- Evaluate best model on Training Data and Testing Data
- Compute ùëÖ2 score and Mean Square Error for best version

## Regularization Techniques

#### Linear Regression with SGD:
- penalty: Lasso Regularization (L1) and Ridge Regularization (L2) are considered.
- alpha: tunes the regularization term. High value means high regularization.

#### Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost:
- max_Depth: reduce the maximum depth of the tree to discourage memorization
- n_estimators: reduce number of decision trees to improve generalization
- max_depth: specify a value to ensure that ùë¨ùíäùíè is not 100 %


## Execution

All files within the folder 'Code' are ipynb files. 

  - data_cleaning.ipynb       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       # goes over data cleaning and feature engineering steps 
  - tune_deTree.ipynb        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        # decision tree model 
  - tune_nn.ipynb           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         # neural network model 
  - tune_randF.ipynb        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         # random forest model 
  - tune_sgd.ipynb          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         # linear regression with sgd model 
  - tune_xgboost.ipynb      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         # xg boost model 

They use relative paths to access the csv files. To run them, ensure that the folder 'Data' is within the Code folder. Or you could use absolute paths to access files from within your desktop. Run each cell of code. Importing Training data can take up to 30 seconds. Training Model can take up to 2 minutes. You can evaluate the performance of the model on two different test sets. In the 'Import Test Data' cell, initialize the variable 'df_test' with the test set of your choice.

## Data

The Data can be downloaded from the following Google Drivelinks.

- [Training Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IgiPMaMyktjIa9qH-5qqSjwFuew9TiPW)
- [Testing Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IhVbX1VwAQf4WzamN8m81sNQTABDWw5y)
